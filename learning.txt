By learning version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub, a person gains the ability to:

>Track changes in code and collaborate with others efficiently

>Revert to earlier versions of files in case of mistakes

>Create and manage branches for different features or experiments

>Work on projects as a team using pull requests and code reviews

>Securely authenticate using Personal Access Tokens (PATs) or SSH keys

Meanwhile, learning Linux commands helps you:

>Navigate the file system efficiently (e.g., cd, ls, pwd)

>Manage files and directories (cp, mv, rm, mkdir)

>Automate tasks using shell scripting

>Install and manage software packages

>Use tools like grep, cat, nano, and chmod to edit and analyze files

Together, these skills are essential for any software developer, especially in open-source collaboration, DevOps, and professional coding environments.
